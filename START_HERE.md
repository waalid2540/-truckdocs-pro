---

3. Deploy
4. Start marketing!

---

## 🚀 DO THIS IN THE NEXT 30 MINUTES

### Step 1: Set Up Your Database (10 minutes)

1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up (free account)
3. Click "New +" → "PostgreSQL"
4. Name it: `truckdocs-db`
5. Leave defaults, click "Create Database"
6. Wait 2 minutes for it to provision
7. **Copy the "External Database URL"** (looks like: `postgresql://username:password@...`)
8. Save it somewhere safe!

### Step 2: Set Up AWS S3 (10 minutes)

**Option A: AWS S3 (most common)**
1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com
2. Sign up (free tier)
3. Go to S3 → "Create bucket"
4. Name it: `truckdocs-files-YOURNAME`
5. Uncheck "Block all public access" (we'll use signed URLs)
6. Create bucket
7. Go to IAM → Users → Create user → Give S3 permissions
8. Create access keys
9. **Save Access Key ID and Secret**

**Option B: Cloudflare R2 (cheaper, easier)**
1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard
2. R2 → Create bucket: `truckdocs-files`
3. Get API token
4. Done! (R2 is S3-compatible but way cheaper)

### Step 3: Set Up Stripe (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://stripe.com
2. Sign up (free account)
3. Go to Developers → API keys
4. **Copy both keys:**
   - Publishable key (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - Secret key (starts with `sk_test_`)
5. Save them!

### Step 4: Configure Your Project (5 minutes)

```bash
cd truckdocs-pro/backend
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # or open in your editor
```

Paste in your values:

```env
DATABASE_URL=paste-your-render-postgresql-url-here
JWT_SECRET=run-this-command: openssl rand -base64 32
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-stripe-key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=truckdocs-files-yourname
```

Save and close!

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

## 💡 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Your Friend is GOLD
Your truck driver friend is your secret weapon:
- He validates the problem is real
- He'll tell his friends (referrals)
- He'll give you honest feedback
- He knows the industry

**Talk to him DAILY in the first month.**

### 2. Keep It Simple
Don't add features users don't ask for. The current feature set is ENOUGH to charge $20/month.

Focus on:
- Making it FAST
- Making it EASY
- Making it RELIABLE

### 3. Focus on IFTA
IFTA is your killer feature. Every owner-operator struggles with this. If you nail IFTA automation, you WIN.

### 4. Price is Right
$20/month is perfect:
- Low enough drivers will pay
- High enough to build a real business
- Easy math: 5,000 users = $100K/month

Don't change pricing until you have 1,000 users.

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Don't**: Spend months adding features before launching
✅ **Do**: Launch with what you have, iterate based on feedback

❌ **Don't**: Build in isolation
✅ **Do**: Talk to truck drivers every day

❌ **Don't**: Charge too little ($5-10/month)
✅ **Do**: Charge what the value is worth ($20/month)

❌ **Don't**: Try to be everything (fleet management, dispatch, etc.)
✅ **Do**: Be the BEST at document management

❌ **Don't**: Give up after first 100 users
✅ **Do**: Keep going, it compounds!

## 📞 WHEN YOU'RE STUCK

### Technical Issues:
- Check `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed debugging
- Backend not starting? Check database connection
- Frontend not loading? Check API URL in .env
- Deployment issues? Render has great support docs

### Product Questions:
- "What feature should I build next?" → Ask your users
- "Should I change pricing?" → Not until 1,000 users
- "How do I market this?" → See marketing section in README.md

### Motivation Issues:
- Remember: Your friend NEEDS this
- 3.5 million truck drivers in USA need this
- You're solving a REAL problem
- Every day you work on this, you're closer to $100K/month
