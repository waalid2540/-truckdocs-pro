# Manual Load Posting - Quick Start Guide

## Phase 1: Manual Load Entry (START TODAY)

### Goal
Post 50-100 fresh loads to your FreightHub Pro load board using free trials from DAT and Truckstop.com

### Time Required
- 2-3 minutes per load
- 50 loads = 2-3 hours total
- Do this daily while waiting for API quotes

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Sign Up for Free Trials

**DAT Load Board** (7-day free trial)
- Go to: https://www.dat.com
- Click "Start Free Trial"
- Use your FreightHub Pro email
- Select "Carrier" as account type

**Truckstop.com** (Trial available)
- Go to: https://truckstop.com
- Request carrier trial
- Similar process to DAT

### 2. Access Your FreightHub Pro Post Load Page

1. Login to https://www.freighthubpro.com
2. Click "Load Board" dropdown (desktop) or menu (mobile)
3. Click "Post Load"
4. Keep this tab open

### 3. Copy Loads Efficiently

**Open DAT in another browser tab/window**

For each load you see on DAT/Truckstop:

#### Required Fields (Must have these):
- ✅ **Origin City** (e.g., "Los Angeles")
- ✅ **Origin State** (e.g., "CA")
- ✅ **Destination City** (e.g., "Phoenix")
- ✅ **Destination State** (e.g., "AZ")
- ✅ **Pickup Date** (e.g., "2025-11-01")
- ✅ **Equipment Type** (Dry Van, Reefer, Flatbed, etc.)
- ✅ **Total Rate** (e.g., "$2,400")

#### Optional But Recommended:
- Distance (miles) - Used to auto-calculate rate per mile
- Weight (lbs)
- Commodity (e.g., "Electronics", "Food Products")
- Broker Company Name
- Contact Phone
- Contact Email
- MC Number

### 4. Example: Copying a Load

**DAT shows:**
```
Chicago, IL → Dallas, TX
Dry Van | 42,000 lbs | 925 miles
$2,100 | $2.27/mile
Pickup: 11/05/2025
Commodity: General Freight
Contact: ABC Logistics (555) 123-4567
MC: 123456
```

**You enter in FreightHub Pro:**
- Origin City: `Chicago`
- Origin State: `IL`
- Destination City: `Dallas`
- Destination State: `TX`
- Pickup Date: `2025-11-05`
- Equipment Type: `Dry Van`
- Total Rate: `2100`
- Distance: `925` (will auto-calculate $2.27/mile)
- Weight: `42000`
- Commodity: `General Freight`
- Broker Company: `ABC Logistics`
- Contact Phone: `555-123-4567`
- MC Number: `MC123456`

**Click "Post Load to Board"** ✅

## Pro Tips for Speed

### 1. Focus on High-Value Loads
- Prioritize loads with rate per mile > $2.00
- Skip loads with sketchy broker info
- Focus on equipment types your drivers use most (probably Dry Van)

### 2. Batch Similar Routes
- Copy 10 loads from CA → TX
- Then 10 loads from TX → FL
- Pattern recognition makes you faster

### 3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts
- Tab between fields
- Don't fill optional fields if DAT doesn't show them
- The more loads, the better (quantity > perfection at this stage)

### 4. Update Daily
- Spend 30 minutes each morning posting 20-30 fresh loads
- Delete old loads (pickup date passed) once per week
- This keeps your board looking active and fresh

---

## Daily Workflow (30 minutes/day)

### Monday-Friday Morning Routine:

**9:00 AM - 9:30 AM: Fresh Load Posting**

1. Open DAT free trial
2. Open FreightHub Pro Post Load page
3. Filter DAT by:
   - Pickup date: Today + 1 to 7 days
   - Equipment: Dry Van (most common)
   - Rate per mile: Minimum $2.00
   - Sort by: Highest paying

4. Copy top 20-30 loads to FreightHub Pro
5. Done!

**Result:** Your drivers see 100-150 live loads at all times

---

## Tracking Your Progress

### Week 1 Goal: 100 Loads Posted
- Monday: 20 loads (2 hours)
- Tuesday: 20 loads (1.5 hours - you're getting faster!)
- Wednesday: 20 loads (1 hour)
- Thursday: 20 loads (1 hour)
- Friday: 20 loads (1 hour)

**Total time investment: 6.5 hours**
**Total loads available to drivers: 100+**

### Week 2-4: Maintenance Mode
- 20-30 fresh loads daily (30 minutes/day)
- Delete expired loads weekly

---

## When to Stop Manual Entry

**Switch to API when:**
1. You receive pricing quotes from DAT/Truckstop/123loadboard
2. You have 50+ active drivers using the platform daily
3. Manual entry becomes too time-consuming (>1 hour/day)

**Expected timeline:** 2-4 weeks

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "I can't find good loads on DAT"
- Filter by pickup date 2-7 days out
- Try different origin states (TX, CA, FL, GA have most loads)
- Lower your minimum rate filter temporarily

### "This is taking too long"
- Skip optional fields for now
- Focus on required fields only
- Speed will come with practice (10 loads in 20 minutes after day 3)

### "Loads are expiring before drivers book them"
- Normal at first - you need more drivers using platform
- Focus on marketing while posting loads
- Post loads with pickup dates 3-7 days out (not 1-2 days)

### "Should I post loads for all equipment types?"
- Start with Dry Van only (80% of drivers)
- Add Reefer/Flatbed once you have 50+ Dry Van loads
- Specialization > variety at this stage

## Questions?

If you encounter issues or want to optimize this process, you can:

1. Check the FreightHub Pro dashboard for load stats
2. Monitor which loads drivers view/book most
3. Double down on those routes and equipment types
4. Adjust your DAT search filters accordingly

**Remember:** Every successful SaaS starts with manual, unscalable work. Uber manually recruited drivers. Airbnb manually photographed listings. You're manually posting loads. This is NORMAL and TEMPORARY.

In 30 days you'll have API integration and this will be automated. But for now, this gets you REVENUE and USERS immediately.

Good luck! You're about to have the most active trucking platform in the Muslim driver community. 🚛💰
