## Speed Tips

1. **Tab key is your friend** - Don't use mouse between fields
2. **Skip optional fields** - Only fill if readily visible on DAT
3. **Round numbers** - $2,487 → Enter as `2487` (no commas or $)
4. **Date format** - Use date picker or type YYYY-MM-DD
5. **Don't overthink** - Imperfect load posted > perfect load not posted

## Best Loads to Post

**Priority Order:**

1. **Rate per mile > $2.50** ⭐⭐⭐
   - These book first
   - Drivers love them
   - Post immediately

2. **Rate per mile $2.00-$2.50** ⭐⭐
   - Solid loads
   - Post these second

3. **Rate per mile $1.50-$2.00** ⭐
   - Acceptable
   - Only if you need volume

4. **Rate per mile < $1.50** ❌
   - Skip these
   - Waste of time
   - Drivers won't book them

---

## Routes That Book Fast

**Post more of these:**

1. CA → TX (High demand)
2. TX → FL (High demand)
3. FL → NJ/NY (High demand)
4. IL → CA (High demand)
5. Midwest → Southwest (Generally good)

**Post fewer of these:**
- Short hauls < 200 miles (drivers prefer long hauls)
- Remote areas (MT, WY, ND, SD)
- Backhaul routes (harder to book)

## Keyboard Shortcuts for Speed

**While in FreightHub Pro form:**

- `Tab` = Next field
